        As much as 90–98 percent of the panda’s diet consists of the leaves, shoots, and stems of
        bamboo, a large grass
        available year-round in much of China’s forested regions. Despite adaptations in the forepaws, teeth,
        and
        jaws for
        bamboo consumption, A panda has retained the digestive system of its carnivore ancestry and is
        therefore unable
        to digest cellulose, a main constituent of bamboo. Pandas solve this problem by rapidly passing
        prodigious
        quantities of
        the grass through their digestive tracts on a daily basis. As much as 16 out of every 24 hours is spent
        feeding, and
        elimination of wastes occurs up to 50 times per day. Fossilized dental remains indicate that the giant
        panda
        committed
        to bamboo as its principal food source at least three million years ago. Although unable to capture
        prey,
        pandas retain
        a taste for meat, which is used as bait to capture them for radio collaring and has made them pests in
        human
        camps on
        occasion. The species cannot naturally survive outside bamboo forests, though in captivity they have
        been
        maintained on
        cereals, milk, and garden fruits and vegetables. Bamboo is the healthier diet for captive pandas.

        The panda’s solitary nature is underscored by its reliance on its sense of smell (olfaction). Each
        animal confines
        its activities to a range of about 4 to 6 square km (1.5 to 2.3 square miles), but these home ranges
        often overlap
        substantially. Under this arrangement scent functions in regulating contact between individuals. A large
        scent gland
        located just below the tail and surrounding the anus is used to leave olfactory messages for other
        pandas. The gland is
        rubbed against trees, rocks, and clumps of grass, with scent conveying information on identity, sex, and
        possibly social
        status of the marking individual. Chemical analysis of marks is consistent with a difference in function
        for males and
        females. Males appear to use scent to identify the areas where they live, whereas females primarily use
        it for signaling
        estrus. Except for the mothers’ care of infants, the only social activity of pandas takes place during
        females’ estrus,
        which occurs annually during the spring and lasts one to three days. A spring mating season (March–May)
        and a fall birth
        season (August–September) are seen in both wild and captive populations. Males appear to locate females
        first by scent
        and ultimately by vocalizations. Assemblages of one to five males per female have been recorded. At this
        time males may
        become highly aggressive as they compete for the opportunity to mate.

        Like bears, pandas undergo a delay in implantation of the fertilized ovum into the wall of the
        uterus,
        a period of
        two to three months after mating. Hormone levels in females’ urine indicate that the period of
        embryonic/fetal growth
        and development lasts only about two months. Altogether, gestation averages 135 days (with a range of
        90–184
        days), but,
        because of the short growth phase, a term fetus weighs only about 112 grams (4 ounces) on average.
        Relative
        to the
        mother, pandas produce the smallest offspring of any placental mammal (about 1/800 of the mother’s
        weight). For
        the first two to three weeks of life, the mother uses her forepaws and her thumblike wrist bones to
        cuddle
        and position
        the infant against herself in a rather uncarnivore-like and almost human fashion. Nearly half of the 133
        captive births
        recorded before 1998 were of twins, but panda mothers are typically unable to care for more than one
        infant.
        Reasons for
        the extremely small size of the offspring and the frequent production of twins are not understood, but
        both
        are traits
        shared with bears.
        The newborn panda is blind and covered with only a thin all-white coat. It is virtually helpless, being
        able
        only to
        suckle and vocalize. It depends on its mother for warmth, nourishment, positioning at the breast, and
        stimulating the
        passage of wastes. Development is slow during the early months. Eyes begin to open at about 45 days, and
        the
        first
        wobbly steps are taken at 75–80 days. Its helpless state mandates birth in a den, an environment in
        which it
        lives for
        the first 100–120 days of life. By about 14 months, at which age the milk teeth have erupted, the infant
        readily
        consumes bamboo, and at 18–24 months weaning from the mother takes place. Separation from the mother
        must
        occur before a
        female can undertake the production of her next litter. Captive pandas may live beyond 30 years in
        captivity, but life
        span in the wild is estimated at about 20 years.
