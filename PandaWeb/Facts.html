        </h1>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>PANDAS HAVE EXCELLENT CAMOUFLAGE FOR THEIR HABITAT</b></p>
        <li>The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and
            communication.
            Most
            of the panda
            - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats. The arms and legs are
            black,
            helping it to
            hide in shade.</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>THEIR EYES ARE DIFFERENT TO NORMAL BEARS</b></p>
        <li>Like domestic cats, giant panda bears have vertical slits for pupils.</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>CUBS ARE WELL PROTECTED IN THEIR FIRST MONTH</b></p>
        <li>Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month - with
            the
            cub
            resting on her
            front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head.</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>PANDAS CAN SWIM AND EVEN CLIMB TREES</b></p>
        <li>Giant pandas are good swimmers and excellent tree climbers. At 5 months old, giant panda cubs learn
            how
            to
            climb -
            sometimes practising by climbing on their mum.</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>A HELPING HAND</b></p>
        <li>They have an extended wrist bone that they use like a thumb to help them grip food.</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>THEY SPEND A LOT OF THEIR DAY EATING</b></p>
        <li>Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo.</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>BAMBOO IS CRITICAL TO THEIR DIET</b></p>
        <li>Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>BUT THEY DO OCCASIONALLY EAT SOMETHING OTHER THAN BAMBOO</b></p>
        <li>A pandaâ€™s diet is 99% vegetarian, which mostly includes bamboo roots, stems, shoots and leaves.
            However
            their digestive
            system is typical of a carnivore, so the remaining 1% of their diet can include eggs, small animals
            and
            carrion. Pandas
            are also known to forage in farmland for pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food.</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>PANDAS SOMETIMES DO HANDSTANDS WHEN THEY WEE!</b></p>
        <li>Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in
            a
            full
            handstand
            upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up.</li>
        <br><br><br>
        <p><b>THEY LIKE TO KEEP IT REGULAR</b></p>
        <li>On average, pandas poo 40 times a day.</li>
